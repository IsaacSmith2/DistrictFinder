HUMMELSTOWN, Pa. — Update: There's been a change in leadership in the Lower Dauphin County School District after complaints of widespread racism and discrimination in the district.
This comes less than two weeks after the state Human Relations Commission issues a statement saying “intimidation and discrimination will not be tolerated.”
FOX43 spoke with one parent who says the issues aren’t new.
"[My son] was called the N-word multiple times," former Lower Dauphin parent Erica Onufer said. "I was told that it was not a big deal and that no disciplinary action needed to be taken."
Onufer's four adopted kids used to be students in the Lower Dauphin School District. She says they experienced racism that ultimately led them to seek other options.
"They were distraught, obviously," Onufer said. "But more than that, they were angry and confused."
In her accounts, Onufer claims the issues went on for years and were ultimately brushed off by staff.
"It all hit the fan, was when staff was not intervening, and was not willing to understand why this was so upsetting to my son or why this was so upset to us as a family," Onufer said.
Now the issue is hitting the fan for the school district.
Last month, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission released a statement acknowledging reports of “intimidation and hostility, in school and on social media platforms, experienced by students of color, LGBTQ students, students with disabilities and others” in the Lower Dauphin School District.
Those issues were addressed at Monday night's school board meeting.
“Since March 17, the entire board has taken 100% ownership of these accusations," Lower Dauphin School Board President Lynn Sassaman said. "And we have worked as a team of 10 to move forward to determine the best solutions for our entire community."
Amid the issue, Lower Dauphin Superintendent Robert Schultz is stepping down from his post after five years on the job.
Final approval of Schultz's resignation was unanimous.

Some members of the community expressed frustration and others came to Schultz’s defense.
“I didn’t see a color, I saw a child," one mother said. "And I just want my children to be recognized as a child and be given the same opportunity and the same respect that children who aren’t their color receive.”
“The man sitting in front of us, ready to resign tonight, is resigning and taking responsibility for something you guys won't put a stop to," another man said during public comment.
Schultz has served in the district for nearly two decades. His resignation will take effect on June 2.
While Onufer’s kids are no longer students in the district, she worries other students will suffer without change.
“Our children deserve better," Onufer said.
Previous: Lower Dauphin School District officials confirmed that Superintendent Robert Schultz has submitted his resignation, which will take effect at the end of the school year.
Shultz's letter to the school board, provided by an LDSD spokesperson, reads as follows:
"On Friday, March 31, I submitted my letter of resignation as Superintendent and my last official day will be Friday, June 2, 2023.
It has been my honor to serve as the educational leader of Lower Dauphin for the past 5 years. As you may know, I have had the privilege of working in the Lower Dauphin School District for 17 of the 31 years of my career in education. Over those years, I have had the opportunity to work with outstanding educators and Board Members who care about their students. And, to work in a community that cares deeply about their school district.
The Lower Dauphin is a very special place and I am sure the School Board will appoint a Superintendent who will lead this district forward to continued success."
Schultz's resignation follows complaints of racism and discriminatory speech at Lower Dauphin High School.
In a statement released by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission on March 23, the organization shared they are aware of allegations of discrimination at the Lower Dauphin School District.
“As the state’s civil rights enforcement agency, PHRC will not overlook its responsibility,” said PHRC Executive Director Chad Dion Lassiter, MSW. “I urge anyone who believes they have experienced discrimination or hate to contact the PHRC, and we will review the situation to see if any laws were violated.
"The PHRC also extends an offer to the Lower Dauphin School District to provide bias and cultural sensitivity training for staff and students. These types of trainings have been offered to schools in the past who have had similar challenges," he continued.
The school board held a meeting on March 27 to address the current climate at the school and provide a path forward.
School board officials are expected to address the change in leadership at Monday night's meeting, which is scheduled to be held in the Lower Dauphin Middle School auditorium at 7 p.m.
